# Adaptive Cruise Control for a Hybrid Vehicle with Deep Policy Gradients
Final project for ECE 517/414 Reinforcement Learning.

## Running Code
Example code is provided to train the REINFORCE and DDPG algorithms and view training curves over a small number of steps. This requires the confidential Blazer Model, and it cannot be ran without it. 

### REINFORCE
